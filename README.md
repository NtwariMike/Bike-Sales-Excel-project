### Project Overview

 This data analysis project aims to providing insights on factors that lead to customers purchasing bikes or not. By analyzing various factors such as Average income, age group and region. We Will be able to identify trends and provide data-driven recommendations.

 ### Data sources

Bike Sales: The primary data set i used for this activity is " Bike-sales.csv" file, containing detailed information about customers and if purchased the bike or not

### Tools
#### Excel
- Data Cleaning: (Filters, Conditional formatting, Removing Duplicates, IFS)
- Data analysis: (Pivot tables)
- Data Visualization: (Column charts, Line charts)

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following,
1. I applied filters to help me understand data and easily navigate through data
2. I applied conditional formatting for duplicate values in the ID column
3. I deleted duplicates
4. For Martital status, I had M and S which sometimes can confuse stakeholders. So I used find and replace (CTR + H) on M to Married and S to Single.
5. For Gender, I had M and F which sometimes can confuse stakeholders. So I used find and replace (CTR + H) on M to Male and F to Female.
6. For the age column, I had to put them into ranges to make it simple when visualizing the data 
     - I inserted a new column called modified-age (21-30) = Adolescent, (31-50) = Adult ,(51-70) = Old, (71-90) = Very old
     - I used =IFS( age >=71, “very old”, age >= 51, “old”, age >= 31, “Adults, age < 31, “Adolescent”)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the bike sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- Which region has high number of purchases and Which country has high number of no purchases
- Which age group has high number of purchases and which age group has high number of no purchases
- Which commute distance contributes more to our sales
- Which factor has high effect on the customer's purchase

### Data Analysis

In order to understand data properly and answer the questions identified, I used three pivot tables.
1. 1st Pivottable: Average income of people who purchased the bikes 
   - Row: Gender, Column: Purchased or not, values: Average income
2. 2nd Pivottable: I created a pivot table for the commute distance and if purchased or not, to see the relationship between distance and purchase.
   - Row: Commute distance, column: Purchased or not, values: Count of yes or no
4. 3rd Pivottable: I created a pivot table for age groups to see which age group is has high purchases
   - Row: age group, column: Purchased or not, values: Count of yes or no


### Results

- The region with high number of purchases is North America and Europe, And also the region with high number of no purchases is  North America, Europe
- The age group with high number of purchases is Adult(31-50), Old(51-70). And also the age group with high number of no purchases is Adult, Old
- Customers with 2-5 miles are the ones purchasing our bikes a lot.
- People who purchased our bikes have higher average income compared to those who did not purchase the bikes, This can be proven using the avaerage income per customer and also people in Adult age group earn more money compared to other age groups.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted, we recommend the following
- Invest in marketing and promotions in North America and Europe to maximise revenues - This is because Those regions have high number of no purchases
- Focus more on people within the Adult and old age group - This is because their income is high hence can afford to buy our bikes
- Reduce the cost of bikes by 10% so that people who make low income can afford to buy them also 


### Limitations

I had some limitations regarding this project because some of th data were missing, the missing data included
- Cost of one bike
- Revenue generated by the bikes
- Taxes imposed in each region


### Sharing

After Careful analysis of data and answering the questions indentified, I created visuals for each pivot table in my dashboard, I also included slicers to make navigation easy for stakeholders.
